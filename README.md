    "price": "$420",
    "departureTime": "02:45 AM",
    "arrivalTime": "10:25 AM",
    "duration": "7h 40m",
    "stops": "1 stop"
  }

## üß™ Development Tips

- To see browser activity, launch Puppeteer in non-headless mode:

```js
puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
```

- If selectors stop working, inspect the DOM and update the scraping logic accordingly.
